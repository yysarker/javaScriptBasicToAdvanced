//Adding Strings and Number

/**
 * Adding two numbers, will return the sum, but adding a number and string will return a string:

//JavaScript Comparison Operators
//Note: (=) This is not Comparison Operators, this is assignment operator

 * Equal value and Equal type (===)
 * Not Equal (!=)
 * Not equal value and not equal type (!==)
 * Grater than (>)
 * Less than (<)
 * Greater than or equal to (>=)
 * Less than or equal to (<=)
 * Ternary Operator (?)

//JavaScript Logical Operators

/**
 * Logical and ( && )
 * Logical or ( || )
 * Logical not ( ! )
 */

//Type Operators
/**
 * typeof // Returns the type of a variable
 * instanceof // Return true if an object is an instance of an object type
 */

//JavaScript Bitwise Operators
/**
 * Bit operators work on 32 bits numbers.
 * 
 * Any numeric operand in the operation is converted into a 32 bit number. The result is converted back to a JavaScript number.
 * 
 * 
 * ( & ) --> AND
 * ( | ) --> OR 
 * ( ~ ) --> NOT
 * ( ^ ) --> XOR
 * ( << ) --> Left shift
 * ( >> ) -->Right shift
 * ( >>> ) --> unsigned right shift
